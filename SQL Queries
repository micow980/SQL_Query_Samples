## You have a table with US rankings of tracks and another table with worldwide rankings of tracks.
## Find the number of days a US track has stayed in the 1st position for both the US and worldwide rankings. Output the track name and the number of days in the 1st position. Order your output alphabetically by track name.

SELECT a.trackname, count(a.date) as num_days1

# Utilizing the rank function
## Find the email activity rank for each user. Email activity rank is defined by the total number of emails sent. The user with the highest number of emails sent will have a rank of 1, and so on. Output the user, total emails, and their activity rank. Order records by the total emails in descending order. Sort users with the same number of emails in alphabetical order.
In your rankings, return a unique value (i.e., a unique rank) even if multiple users have the same number of emails.

SELECT
    from_user,
    count(id) as sent_items,
    rank() over(order by count(id) desc, from_user) as rank_order
FROM
